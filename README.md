# JugendhacktApp

We love Jugendhackt!
Therefore we want to contribute to it with this App - The Jugendhackt App!
The App will have plenty of features for Jugendhackt - even some which doesn't exist in any other form yet!

## Features
- Lost and Found, forgot something or lost something at Jugendhackt? Ask for it here!
- News & Updates, The News & Update Feed from Jugendhackt, in an app!
- Event Based Details, Fun Details like Network Traffic
- Hanno's QR Code Support - Hanno, hope you like it.
- Digital Badge Collection - The stickers are great, but also stuck on your old notebook - Let's make the badge collection digital as well!
